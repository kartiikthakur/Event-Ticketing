Currents by Mayumana,"<div class=""content"">
<div class=""show-run"">
<span>Sunday, March 10, 2019</span> </div>
<p>“…Non stop action pack…Part dance, part acrobatics, nothing like we ever saw.” —ABC News</p>
<p>“No dull moment, from the very first moment of the show the audience is spellbound… steaming spectacular rhythms… a must for your eyes, ears and your feeling!” —De Zondag, Belgium</p>
<p>“Show full of energy… extraordinary coordination between music and movement.” —Canela e hortela, Portugal</p>
<p>CURRENTS<br/>
‘Currents’ is a spectacular show that was inspired by the historical Battle of Currents between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla in their quest for finding energy sources for the world. Audience members will be taken on a journey between two troops, each representing a different view of the essence of light and electricity and each inspired by a different esthetic and artistic approach, all of which are presented as a dialogue, through unique sounds, lights, and visual effects. The show combines a variety of elements: specially made musical instruments, massive video art projections (including video mapping on the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem) and eleven skilled performers in constant movement, playing on different instruments and musically juggling between different sounds.</p>
<p>MAYUMANA<br/>
In 1996, Elyon Nuphar and Boaz Berman, driven by their deep love for percussion and music, created the first Mayumana show. From around the world, Berman and Nuphar gathered a small group of gifted performers, each with diverse talents and contrasting backgrounds. Sparked by their shared passion for rhythm and coordination, and fueled by their unique sense of humor and mischief, their group dynamic on stage was inexhaustible and infectious. Enriched by working with a multicultural cast, they inspired each other to fulfill the individual’s prowess in his/her area of expertise, while developing in all players the versatility to master other skills. This befits the name Mayumana, which comes from the Hebrew word for skill – Meyumanut. The power of each Mayumana creation comes from the strong emphasis placed on the unity and synchronization of the group as a whole. At the same time, the talent and beauty of the individual performer is highlighted and celebrated. Mayumana’s playfulness extends beyond the stage, reaching out to engage in direct interactions with its audiences of all ages and cultures. Sixteen years later with performers from more than 20 different nationalities, Mayumana has become one of Israel’s leading cultural exports. It has entertained millions of people around the world with its international touring cast, as well as in its home theatre, The Mayumana House, which is located at the old harbor of Jaffa.</p>

It's a Wonderful Life: Live from WVL Radio Theatre,"<div class=""content"">
<div class=""show-run"">
<span>Wednesday, December 19, 2018</span> </div>
<p>It’s Christmas Eve in 1945, and only a handful of WVL Radio’s actors have braved the blizzard to perform that evening’s broadcast of It’s a Wonderful Life and keep the station afloat. This clever stage adaptation breathes new life into the poignant story of George Bailey and Bedford Falls.</p>
<p>When Frank Capra and his co-writers were working on the original screenplay of It’s a Wonderful Life, the Great Depression was a vivid memory. The story of George Bailey and Bedford Falls is juxtaposed against a time of failing banks, devastatingly high unemployment and a shortage of affordable housing. The circumstances are eerily familiar, and over 60 years later, this story remains as fresh and relevant as ever. Its message of hope and optimism is the perfect antidote to holiday cynicism.</p>
<p>Run Time: 1 hour and 50 minutes, including a 15 min intermission</p>

<p>“Spirited…lively!…memorable musical celebration…the warmth and good cheer would have felt good in any season”<br/>
-PORTLAND PRESS HERALD</p>
<p>The Eighth Step presents TURNING OF THE YEAR: A Celtic Holiday Mini-Fest, an intergenerational extravaganza of traditional Irish button accordion, Scottish &amp; Cape Breton fiddle, guitars, mandolin and harmony singing!</p>
<p>Alongside fast jigs and reels will be lesser-known Christmas carols and wintry classics: two fiddles, accordion, guitars, mandolin, double bass and lush, layered vocals. The generations come together for a fresh new take on roots music from both sides of the pond. Traditional and original music from Ireland, Scotland and America makes for a diverse and high-energy evening to help usher in the holiday season.</p>
<p>Seven Times All-Ireland Fiddle Champion and Narada recording artist JOHN WHELAN teams up with American Roots Band LOW LILY, and KATIE McNALLY on Scottish and Cape Breton fiddle. The ensemble brings an exciting, mix of Irish and Scottish music, modern American string band music and harmonious vocals to celebrate the upcoming Winter holidays.</p>
<p>Whelan, original Riverdance cast member, leads the ensemble with seemingly endless personality and energy. Long-time fans remember his Irish fusion band Kips Bay Coeli Band, a powerhouse of immigrant talent, or his fabulous duo performances on our stage with band mate Pat Kilbride.</p>
<p>Low Lily is Liz Simmons on vocals &amp; guitar, Flynn Cohen on vocals, guitar, mandolin, and Lissa Schneckenburge on vocals, fiddle.</p>
<p>This evening brings more than a triple bill – the artists mix solos, duos and everything-in-between. From the sweet sound of the accordion with simple but lush guitar textures behind it, to a blast of reels with everyone playing, to an American song ringing with soaring three-part harmony, this show bursts with life!</p>

Passport Series: Edmar Castaneda Trio,"<div class=""content"">
<div class=""show-run"">
<span>Friday, November 30, 2018</span> </div>
<p>Since arriving in the United States in 1994, Colombian-born harp virtuoso Edmar Castaneda has forged his own distinctive path in music. He brings not only an unfamiliar instrument but a wholly original voice to jazz, branching out into a world of different styles and genres. His wide-ranging career has been remarkable for discovering a brilliant role for the harp in jazz, then continuing to innovate and spark creativity from a wealth of formidable collaborations. His latest CD, Live in Montreal, features the latest in an ever-growing history of thrilling partnerships, an utterly unique duo with the electrifying Japanese pianist Hiromi.</p>
<p>Born in 1978 in the city of Bogotá, Colombia, Castaneda took up the harp as a teenager to play the folkloric music of his homeland. He discovered jazz shortly after moving to New York City to join his father in 1994 and was immediately drawn to the freedom and sophistication of the music. With no real precedent for the harp in the jazz world, Castaneda studied trumpet by day while trying out his newfound knowledge on the harp at a restaurant gig by night.</p>
<p>He was ushered into the jazz community by Paquito D’Rivera, who recognized Castaneda’s passion and took the young harpist under his wing. D’Rivera has called him “an enormous talent… [Edmar] has the versatility and the enchanting charisma of a musician who has taken his harp out of the shadow to become one of the most original musicians from the Big Apple.”</p>
<p>Since then, Castaneda has taken New York and the world stage by storm with the sheer force of his virtuosic command of the harp, revolutionizing the way audiences and critics alike consider an instrument commonly relegated to the “unusual category”. He’s been acclaimed as a master at realizing beautiful complexities of time, while skillfully drawing out lush colors and dynamic spirit and crafting almost unbelievable feats of cross-rhythms, layered with chordal nuances rivaling the most celebrated flamenco guitarist’s efforts.</p>

<p><strong>The Gibson Brothers North Country Christmas</strong><br/>
December 7, 2018</p>
<p>THE GIBSON BROTHERS’ BRAND of bluegrass is a visceral mix of heritage and soaring harmony, making them the premiere brother duet of the genre, following in the footsteps of legendary brother acts such as the Stanley Brothers, Jim &amp; Jesse, and the Osborne Brothers. Their first-ever album of entirely original songs, In the Ground sees the Gibson Brothers taking on their own roots as the sixth generation to grow up on their family farm. The two-time International Bluegrass Music Association Entertainers of the Year follow up their stellar, 5-times nominated tribute to brother harmonies, Brotherhood, with this latest effort, which digs even deeper into their commitment to family and their history. The themes come from the farm, their childhood, and the region in which they were raised. One can hear their dedication to the songs, from the lighthearted to the profound; in the modernity of the lyrics, matched with a virtuosity that feels somehow both traditional and revelatory. Featuring celebrated, award-winning Dobro player Rob Ickes, In the Ground reaches into new territory for the Gibson Brothers as they reflect on their past.</p>
<p>The Gibson Brothers North Country Christmas Shows have become a tradition in their hometown. This year they are taking this show on the road bringing family and friends along to celebrate the holidays with you.</p>

<span>Friday, January 11, 2019</span> </div>
<p>Fresh off the hugely successful The River Tour 2016-2017 of Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band—where the group played 89 concerts nearly four hours long each night in 15 countries amassing $300,000,000 in ticket sales, Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Drummer Max Weinberg announces a new touring concept for the small venue—“Max Weinberg’s Jukebox” and it’s coming to Proctors! <span> </span></p>
<p>A truly interactive experience, Weinberg invites the audience to create in real time the set list he and his crack four piece group will play that night. Performing songs from the glory days of rock and roll your guests get to choose from a video menu of over 200 songs– everything from the Beatles to the Stones to Bruce and The E Street Band’s biggest hits—and hear the group play ‘em the way they want to hear them played! <span> </span></p>
<p>That’s right—the crowd gets to yell out their choices and Max plays them! This unique approach is fun and satisfying. How many times have you attended a show where you yearned to hear your favorite performer play your favorite song? With Max Weinberg’s Jukebox your dream will be realized. <span> </span></p>
<p>Weinberg, the driving rhythmic force propelling The E Street Band for 43 years, is also known to millions of fans for his 17 year stint as the bandleader and comedic foil to talk show host Conan O’Brien and is the only musician in history to make the leap from a starring role in one of the world’s iconic rock groups to leading his eponymous band on NBC’s “Late Night” and “The Tonight Show”. And if that wasn’t enough Weinberg managed to do both gigs simultaneously from 1999-2009. <span> </span></p>

His work has earned him an Academy Award®, five Grammy® awards, an Emmy®, the Mark Twain Award, and the Kennedy Center Honors.</p> <p>Martin began his career on “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour” (1967-1969), for which he earned his first Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy, Variety or Music in 1969. In the mid-1970s, Martin shone as a stand-up on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” and NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” Martin’s films are widely popular successes and are the kind of movies that are viewed again and again: <em>The Jerk</em> (1979), <em>Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles</em> (1987), <em>Roxanne</em> (1987), <em>Parenthood</em> (1989), <em>L.A. Story</em> (1991), <em>Father of the Bride</em> (1991), and <em>Bowfinger</em> (1999).</p> <p>Steve Martin is also an accomplished Grammy Award-winning, boundary-pushing bluegrass banjoist and composer.

He made his debut in “Three Amigos” and followed with “Innerspace,” “Three Fugitives,” “Clifford,” “Pure Luck” and “Tim Burton’s Mars Attacks.” One of Short’s most memorable roles was in the remake of “Father of the Bride” as Franck the wedding planner, a role he reprised a few years later in “Father of the Bride Part II.” Short lent his voice to the animated film “Madagascar 3” and Tim Burton’s Oscar-nominated “Frankenweenie.”</p> <p>An accomplished stage actor, Short won a Tony, Theatre World Award and an Outer Critics Circle Award for his role in the revival of “Little Me.” He was also nominated for a Tony and took home an Outer Critics Circle Award for the musical version of Neil Simon’s “The Goodbye Girl.” Short co-wrote and starred in “Fame Becomes Me,” prompting The New York Times to describe Short as “a natural for live musicals, a limber singer and dancer who exudes a fiery energy that makes you want to reach for your sunglasses.” Short most recently appeared on Broadway in Terrence McNally’s “It’s Only a Play.”</p> <p>A two-time Primetime Emmy winner and multi-nominated for both primetime and daytime Emmys, Short returned to television in 1998 for the miniseries “Merlin” and host of “The Martin Short Show.” In 2001, he launched the popular comedy “Primetime Glick and in 2010 received critical acclaim for his role in FX’s drama series “Damages.”</p> <p>Short has also returned to “SNL” as host three times, and performed in the series’ landmark 40th anniversary special in February 2015. Other recent television credits include “Hairspray Live!” “Maya &amp; Marty,” “Mulaney,” “How I Met Your Mother” and the critically acclaimed PBS series “Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That.”</p> <p>Short’s New York Times bestselling memoir,<strong> “I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend, ”was published in 2014.</strong></p> <p>In 1994, Short was awarded the Order of Canada — the Canadian equivalent to British knighthood. He was also inducted into the Canadian Walk of Fame in June 2000. This year he received a Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award from the Governor-general of Canada. Short’s 2018 Netflix special with Steve Martin titled “An Evening You Will Forget For The Rest Of Your Life” received 4 Emmy nominations.

<p>National Geographic Live On the Trail of Big Cats: Tigers, Cougars, and Snow Leopards<br/>
Steve Winter, Photographer<br/>
November 14th, 2018</p>
<p>Go around the world in search of big cats with award-winning photographer Steve Winter. A determined explorer, Winter will lead you from Asian jungles where resilient tiger populations persist, to the Himalaya, home of the rare snow leopard. Follow him into the rainforests of Latin America to view the elusive jaguar-and to Hollywood in pursuit of the American cougar. He’ll share both dangerous and lighter moments: from getting stuck in quicksand to mishaps with remote-controlled cameras. Co-author of the National Geographic book Tigers Forever, Winter’s mission is to share the beauty of big cats while working to save them.</p>

<div><strong>Celebrate Mardi Gras with The Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Cha Wa!</strong></div>
<p>The Dirty Dozen Brass Band celebrating over 40 years since their founding in 1977, New Orleans-based Dirty Dozen Brass Band has taken the traditional foundation of brass band music and incorporated it into a blend of genres including Bebop Jazz, Funk and R&amp;B/Soul. This unique sound, described by the band as a ‘musical gumbo,’ has allowed the Dirty Dozen to tour across 5 continents and more than 30 countries, record 12 studio albums and collaborate with a range of artists from Modest Mouse to Widespread Panic to Norah Jones. Forty-plus years later, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band is a world famous music machine whose name is synonymous with genre bending romps and high-octane performances.</p>

<p>TJ Norris – Trombone/Vocals</p>
<p>Julian Addison – Drums</p>
<p>Takeshi Shimmura – Guitar</p>
<p>The History of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band In 1977, The Dirty Dozen Social and Pleasure Club in New Orleans began showcasing a traditional Crescent City brass band. It was a joining of two proud, but antiquated, traditions at the time: social and pleasure clubs dated back over a century to a time when black southerners could rarely afford life insurance, and the clubs would provide proper funeral arrangements. Brass bands, early predecessors of jazz as we know it, would often follow the funeral procession playing somber dirges, then once the family of the deceased was out of earshot, burst into jubilant dance tunes as casual onlookers danced in the streets. By the late ’70s, few of either existed. The Dirty Dozen Social and Pleasure Club decided to assemble this group as a house band, and over the course of these early gigs, the seven-member ensemble adopted the venue’s name: The Dirty Dozen Brass Band.</p>

<p>New Orleans brass band-meets-Mardi Gras Indian outfit Cha Wa radiates the energy of the city’s street culture. Their album “Spyboy” (a nod to frontman J’Wan Boudreaux’s role in the Golden Eagles) is a modern mix of fiery, toe-tapping sounds. Popmatters describes the band as “a grand gumbo of singing, intoxicating rhythms, and deep funk grooves that are impossible to resist.”</p>

His storytelling has the richness of fine literature” WASHINGTON POST</p> <p>“The most impressive instrumentalist I’ve ever heard”- JOHNNY CASH</p> <p>Singer-songwriter, storyteller and master instrumentalist McCutcheon celebrates folk legend Pete Seeger’s 100th birthday with a blockbuster album of Seeger songs!</p> <p>Pete Seeger introduced America to itself, one song at a time. Whether it was “Erie Canal” or “If I Had a Hammer,” he told us who we are and helped us imagine who we might become. John McCutcheon’s stunning new collection celebrates Pete’s 100th birthday (May 2019) with a recording of some songs that moved him the most during his long years as Seeger student, admirer, colleague and friend. From “Sailing Down My Golden River” to Turn, Turn, Turn,” it’s a big and loving tribute to an amazing man, musician, American.</p> <p>One of America’s most respected and loved folksingers, McCutcheon is a master of a dozen different traditional instruments, most uniquely the rare and beautiful hammer dulcimer. Hailed by critics and singers around the globe, his 30 recordings have garnered every imaginable honor, including seven Grammy nominations.</p> <p>Whether in print, on record, or on stage, few people communicate with the versatility, charm, wit or pure talent of John McCutcheon. But in live performance McCutcheon feels most at home. He has brought his music into the lives and homes of one of the broadest audiences any folk musician has ever enjoyed, certainly echoing Seeger himself. People of every generation and background seem to feel at home in a concert hall when John McCutcheon takes the stage, with what critics describe as “little feats of magic,” “breathtaking in their ease and grace…” and “like a conversation with an illuminating old friend.”</p> </div>"

<p><em>Exhibition On Screen presents</em><br/>
<strong>REMBRANDT</strong><br/>
<em>From the National Gallery, London and Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam</em></p>
<p>For many, Rembrandt is the greatest artist that ever lived and this deeply moving film seeks to explore the truth about the man behind the legend. Every Rembrandt exhibition is eagerly anticipated but this major show – hosted by London’s National Gallery and Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum – was an event like no other. Given privileged access to both galleries, the film explores many of the exhibition’s key works, through contributions from specially invited guest curators and leading art historians. Rembrandt’s life story is also interwoven, as are the behind-the-scenes preparations at the two world famous institutions. Not rated. 90 minutes</p>

Passport Series: Sona Jobarteh,"<div class=""content"">
<div class=""show-run"">
<span>Wednesday, October 10, 2018</span> </div>
<p>Sona Jobarteh is the first female Kora virtuoso to come from a west African Griot family. Breaking away from tradition, she is a pioneer in an ancient male-dominated hereditary tradition that has been exclusively handed down from father to son for the past seven centuries. Reputed for her skill as an instrumentalist, distinctive voice, infectious melodies and her grace onstage, Sona has rapidly risen to international success following the release of her critically acclaimed album “Fasiya” (Heritage) in 2011.</p>
<p>The Kora (a 21-stringed African harp) is one of the most important instruments belonging to the Manding peoples of West Africa (Gambia, Senegal, Mali, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau). It belongs exclusively to griot families (hereditary musical families), and only those who are born into one of these families have the right to take up the instrument professionally. Sona, who was born into one of the five principal Griot families, has become the first female to take up this instrument professionally in a male tradition that dates back over seven centuries.</p>
<p>Sona’s family carries a heavy reputation for renowned Kora masters, notably her grandfather Amadu Bansang Jobarteh who was an icon in Gambia’s cultural and musical history, and her cousin Toumani Diabaté who is renowned for his mastery of the Kora.</p>
<p>In recent years Sona has quickly been rising to international success, headlining major festivals around the world in Brazil, India, South Korea, Ghana, Mexico, Tanzania, Cote D’Ivoire, Lithuania, Poland and Malaysia just to name a few. Sona and her music has the unique ability to touch audiences from all backgrounds and cultures.</p>

The Naughty List: Staged Readings,"<div class=""content""> <div class=""show-run""> <span>Friday, December 28, 2018</span> </div> <p>“On Christmas Eve in 1934, a hard-hearted nightclub chanteuse rekindles her Christmas spirit when she rescues Santa Claus from the clutches of a dastardly, scheming toy maker who is bent on becoming the New King of Christmas!”</p> <p><strong>HAVE FUN WHILE LEARNING</strong><br/> THE NAUGHTY LIST staged readings inspire an enjoyable holiday-themed outing while offering adults and children (age 7 and up) a unique opportunity to learn about how plays become productions.</p> <p>Adults of all ages and children (ages 7 and up) will have the chance to enjoy a professional staged reading of THE NAUGHTY LIST and then share their observations and ask questions about the process during a friendly and informative “talkback” with the cast, crew, director and playwright following both stage readings.</p> <p>Thanks to PROCTORS’ generous, ongoing tradition of encouraging the development of new works for the stage, we are thrilled to be able to present TWO opportunities for holiday theatregoers to play an important role in the development process of this vibrant and socially relevant Christmas holiday-themed play that’s on its way up!</p> <p>*Please join us for an audience reception before the 7 PM staged reading.</p> <p><strong>THE TALKBACKS</strong><br/> After both staged readings, audience members will have the opportunity to participate in a Q&amp;A-style discussion called a “talkback”. They will engage with the cast, crew, director and playwright, discussing the story, script development and the staged reading as foundational elements of the theatrical process. These behind-the-scenes exchanges between artists and audience extend special access to the creative construct of the play and are vital to its future development!</p> <p>A little more about THE NAUGHTY LIST<br/> THE NAUGHTY LIST is a Christmas/Santa-themed play for multi-generational audiences set in the golden age of Hollywood pictures. It is a dynamic holiday story with both new and familiar characters and a sprinkling of music and magic. The story takes place on Christmas Eve,1934, in the world of Film Noir. It brings to the stage a thought-provoking story wrapped up in a delightful comic convention.</p> <p><strong>What is a Staged Reading?</strong><br/> A staged reading of a script is when the script is performed vocally by masterful actors, with few of the bells and whistles, such as costumes and other fancy things that are found in a fully-staged performance of the script. This minimalistic presentation style encourages the audience to focus on the story being presented and to use their imaginations to envision the characters, action, settings, the lighting and the costumes in their own, unique way!</p> <p><strong>Why a Talkback?</strong><br/> Talkbacks are important because YOUR opinions are important. Your opinions and observations are taken into serious consideration during the continued development of the script as it moves forward toward a full production. This direct interaction between audience members and creatives is the primary reason for a reading and are very jolly things to be part of!</p> <p>For questions, kindly email TNLXMASPLAY@gmail.com</p> </div>"

<p>Choreography: Kenneth MacMillan.  Music: Sergei Prokofiev</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers encounter passion and tragedy in MacMillan’s 20th-century ballet masterpiece. Since its 1965 premiere with The Royal Ballet, Kenneth MacMillan’s Romeo and Juliet has become a modern ballet classic. The choreography captures the emotions of the young couple as they fall in love, despite the barriers that finally bring about the story’s tragic end.Each revival gives opportunities for new dancers to interpret the doomed lovers. The whole Company brings the color and action of Renaissance Verona, where a busy market all too quickly bursts into sword fighting, and a family feud leads to tragedy for both the Montagues and Capulets. Estimated running time: 195 minutes incl. two Intermissions.<b></b></p>

<p>National Geographic Live View From Above<br/>
Terry Virts, NASA Astronaut<br/>
January 31st, 2019</p>
<p>Sometimes, a little distance is all you need to see things in a brand-new way. For astronaut Terry Virts, his newfound perspective was from the International Space Station (ISS), where he installed the Cupola module, granting an unprecedented 360-degree view from the station. When he later became the commander of the ISS, he made good use of the Cupola, taking more photographs than any astronaut who came before him. Many of those images were later used in the National Geographic book View From Above and IMAX film A Beautiful Planet, but to hear Virts tell it, no photo can capture the perfect shade of blue from a sunrise viewed from outer space.</p>

<p>Inspired by the beloved films, the romantic and adventure-filled new musical ANASTASIA is on a journey to Schenectady at last!</p>
<p>From the Tony Award®-winning creators of the Broadway classic <em>Ragtime</em>, this dazzling show transports us from the twilight of the Russian Empire to the euphoria of Paris in the 1920s, as a brave young woman sets out to discover the mystery of her past. Pursued by a ruthless Soviet officer determined to silence her, Anya enlists the aid of a dashing conman and a lovable ex-aristocrat. Together, they embark on an epic adventure to help her find home, love, and family. </p>
<p>ANASTASIA features a book by celebrated playwright Terrence McNally, a lush new score by Stephen Flaherty (music) and Lynn Ahrens (lyrics) with direction by Tony Award® winner Darko Tresnjak.</p>

<p>Dubbed a poet with a camera, photojournalist Bob Paley served Albany’s <i>Knickerbocker News</i> for nearly 30 years.  Also a contributor to legendarily selective <i>Time-Life </i>publications, Paley had the uncanny ability – with a single photo –  to capture the mood, the moment and the meaning of the forces that rocked mid-twentieth century America, whether they be Woodstock, Vietnam, the Kennedy brothers, or the American struggle for civil rights.</p>
<p><b>More Than Words</b> also tells the story of how a small upstate New York community coped with the powerful forces unleashed in America as our country came of age in the years following World War II.  Drawing heavily from Paley’s photo library, the film additionally includes valuable and fascinating personal testimony from those who lived through the turbulent times.   </p>
<p>Paley’s daughter, film director Mary Paley, will attend the screening  – along with other key members of her crew – to discuss their collective efforts.</p>

<p>National Geographic Live Ocean Soul<br/>
Brian Skerry, Underwater Photographer<br/>
March 14th, 2019</p>
<p>Voyage across the oceans with one of National Geographic’s most seasoned photographers and discover a vast, hidden world beneath the waves. Using his camera to communicate, Brian Skerry has spent more than 10,000 hours underwater telling the oceans’ stories. His images celebrate the mystery of the depths and offer portraits of creatures so intimate they sometimes appear to have been shot in a studio. Skerry dives eight months of the year, often in extreme conditions beneath Arctic ice or in predator-infested waters, and has even lived at the bottom of the sea to get close to his subjects. This past fall, National Geographic Books published Ocean Soul, a landmark retrospective of Skerry’s photographs. In the book and this presentation, Skerry takes us from the glacial waters of the North Atlantic, where harp seals face off with commercial hunters, to the balmy central Pacific, where he photographed damaged coral ecosystems rebuilding themselves. On stage, Skerry is a passionate spokesman for the oceans he loves to photograph. His riveting presentations to audiences at TED, Harvard, and London’s Royal Geographic Society inspire reverence for the marine realm and offer hope for protecting the vitality of the world’s oceans.</p>

<p><em>Exhibition On Screen presents</em><br/>
<strong>YOUNG PICASSO</strong></p>
<p>Pablo Picasso is one of the greatest artists of all time – and right up until his death in 1973 he was also one of the most prolific. Many films have dealt with his later years – the art, the affairs and the wide circle of friends – but where did this all begin? Too long ignored, it is time to look at the early years of Picasso; the upbringing and the learning that led to his extraordinary achievements. Three cities play a key role: Malaga, Barcelona and Paris. Young Picasso visits each, working closely with all three Picasso Museums, to explore each city’s influence on the artist. Looking carefully at his so-called Blue Period and Rose Period, the film takes us all the way back to 1907 and the creation of a critical painting in the history of art – <em>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon</em>. Though Picasso was merely 25 years old, his painting shocked the art world… and changed it irrevocably. Not rated. 85 minutes.</p>

<h3><strong>CELEBRATING THE MUSIC OF PHISH THROUGH THE LENS OF JAZZ</strong></h3>
<p>JAZZ IS PHSH is an instrumental tribute to Phish inspired by the popular tribute to The Grateful Dead, “Jazz is Dead”. JAZZ IS PHSH is a collective of prominent musicians from the Jazz and Jam scenes that have come together in their appreciation of Phish music to reimagine Phish in an instrumental, jazz fusion setting! The arrangements and performances of the band are built around their upcoming album which will feature many amazing musicians including Dennis Chambers (Santana, Miles Davis, Parliament Funkadelic), Jeff Coffin (Dave Matthews Band, The Flecktones), Chris Bullock (Snarky Puppy), Michael Ray (Sun Ra, Giant Country Horns, Cosmic Crewe), Kofi Burbridge (Tedeschi Trucks Band, Aquarium Rescue Unit, Trey Anastasio Band), Grant Green Jr. (Groove Masters), Anthony Wellington (Victor Wooten Band), &amp; many more!</p>
<p>Founded in 2015 by The Chase Brothers, Adam Chase and Matthew Chase, JAZZ IS PHSH has quickly become a world renown tribute to Phish, attracting some of the most influential musicians in the jazz and jam scenes to take part in this collective approach to paying tribute to one of the most important and influential bands in Rock and Roll history.</p>
<p>With the music of Phish being both largely improvised as well as highly composed, the framework of Phish’s music is the perfect vehicle for exploring in an instrumental setting. The compositions are both challenging and adaptive. Jazz IS PHSH provides an exploration of Phish music unlike anything else.</p>

Passport Series: Mokoomba,"<div class=""content"">
<div class=""show-run"">
<span>Thursday, April 11, 2019</span> </div>
<p>Mokoomba is one of Africa’s most exciting young bands, dazzling audiences worldwide with their knockout live shows and potent blend of traditional Tonga, Luvale, &amp; Nyanja sounds laced with international styles from soukous to soul.</p>
<p>Mokoomba is based in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. The band’s six members, Mathias Muzaza (lead vocals), Ndaba Coster Moyo (drums, backing vocals), Trustworth Samende (lead guitar, backing vocals), Donald Moyo, (keyboards, backing vocals), Miti Mugande, (percussion &amp; backing vocals) and Abundance Mutori (bass, backing vocals) grew up as friends in the Chinotimba township.</p>
<p>Living in a border city that attracts tourists from all over the world gave Mokoomba’s music an international perspective from the beginning, incorporating everything from reggae to afropop to soul alongside their own local musical traditions.</p>
<p>The group’s members began playing together as teenagers in 2001, and Mokoomba was officially formed in 2008. Their first major success came that same year, when they won the Music Crossroads Inter-Regional Festival Competition in Malawi.</p>
<p>In 2009 Mokoomba recorded its first album, Kweseka — Drifting Ahead, which generated a local hit “Messe Messe”, and the group’s first European tour. Mokoomba recorded a second EP, Umvundla, in 2011. But their big break came in 2012, when the band released Rising Tide produced by pioneering Ivoirian bassist Manou Gallo (Zap Mama) for the Belgian label ZigZag World.</p>
<p>The success of Rising Tide led Mokoomba to tour over 40 countries worldwide, including performances at Denmark’s Roskilde festival, the UK’s WOMAD festival, Belgium’s Couleur Cafe´ festival, Morocco’s annual Gnawa World Music festival and New Orleans’ storied Jazz and Heritage Festival.</p>
<p>In February 2017 Mokoomba released its self-produced third album Luyando on Germany’s OutHere label, a stripped down, mostly acoustic album that took their sound in a whole new direction, and took critics by storm.</p>
<p>Since then, Mokoomba has become one of Zimbabwe’s most popular bands, playing with such icons as Hugh Masekela, Baba Maal and the Talking Head’s Tina Weymouth and Chris Franz. They’ve rocked legendary rooms and stages worldwide, from NYC’s Apollo Theater, and The Kennedy Center is Washington, D.C., to London’s 100 Club and Amsterdam’s Melkweg, to WOMEX and SXSW, sealing their reputation as one of Africa’s best young live bands.</p>

Bobby Collins,"<div class=""content"">
<div class=""show-run"">
<span>Thursday, March 14, 2019</span> </div>
<p>Comedian Bobby Collins has an ability to truthfully translate the human condition. Audiences across the country relate to his comedic characterizations as he exposes the humor of day-to-day situations as well as serving up resplendent rants on world events.   </p>
<p>Through precise physical timing and impeccable audience insight, he has honed his talents while performing from hole in the wall clubs to sold out theaters. Bobby was nominated for a Grammy , performed at The White House ,  performed on all three Tonight Shows with Johnny , Jay and Jimmy , and is a bestselling author   Bobby Collins’ rise to top headlining, comedic master was inevitable.  His true dedication to his craft is what keeps his vibrant shows consistently sold out.  </p>
<p>A native New Yorker, Collins possesses a confidence and genuine everyman likeability that can only be earned. He knows what it’s like to work a day job, in order to pursue a dream. He’s flipped his share of burgers, as well as signing on as a substitute high school history teacher, to pay the bills – all the while performing in comedy clubs at night.   </p>
<p>After heeding a conversation with his father, with some trepidation, he ventured into sales.  Settling into the high fashion industry.  A detour that proved so successful, that in the 1980’s he had risen to Vice President at Calvin Klein.  It was there that he found himself faced with a life changing decision; remain here or chuck the security (and more than substantial steady income) for the uncertain challenge of heading out on the road – to pursue his dream of becoming a professional, full time stand-up comedian.  </p>
<p> It was a decision he’s never regretted.  </p>
<p>Realizing his dream has given Bobby the opportunity to tour with titans of entertainment like Frank Sinatra, Cher, Julio Iglesias and Dolly Parton.  As a professional stand-up comedian, he’s worked alongside friends, Chris Rock, Ray Romano and Drew Carey, as well as many others.  Rosie O’Donnell specifically requested that Bobby take over as host for Stand-Up Spotlight.  Collins is widely regarded as a “comic’s comic.”  </p>
<p>Through his personal appearances at Comedy Clubs, Theaters, Corporate and Charity events, coupled with innumerable television appearances on legendary shows like Letterman, The Tonight Show with both Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno, Collins continues to add new fans of all ages to his loyal base of diehard followers.  </p>
<p>It is his relationship with his audiences that results in sold out shows everywhere he makes an appearance.  What you see is what you get – Collins is the same man on and off the stage.  <i>Bobby Collins has a genuine love for what he does</i>.  With such skillful dissection of everyday life, he weaves his uproarious storytelling with effortless flair and charisma as he successfully dismantles any and all socioeconomic, race and age divides. As evidenced by his birthday performance for Chelsea Clinton at the White House, to appearances in US embassies and USO shows abroad.  Night after night, Bobby Collins masterfully reflects the hilarious truth – we’re <i>all</i> in this together! </p>
<p>Bobby currently has 5 CD’s, 3 DVD’s and a new special slated for early 2018. </p>
<p>With the critically acclaimed publication of his first book, “<i>On The Inside – </i><i>Witisms</i><i> and </i><i>Wisdomisms</i><i> by Comedian Bobby Collins</i>” we learn, through his personal and professional tragedies and triumphs, what has shaped his beliefs. With humorous recall, Bobby recounts his search for balance between career and family.  </p>

Icons of Vinyl,"<div class=""content"">
<div class=""show-run"">
<span>Saturday, January 26, 2019</span> </div>
<p>Icons of Vinyl is The Ultimate Tribute Tour. This special night features the highest tribute grossing acts to The Eagles, Eric Clapton and Tom Petty. Fans will get to hear three amazing sets, featuring hits and b-sides from their favorite acts they know and love.</p>
<p><strong>Eaglemania:</strong><br/>
Eaglemania has evolved into a nationally touring tribute to The Eagles, performing to sold out audiences everywhere they go. Their music appeals to a wide variety of age groups, and the combination of heartfelt ballads, rock anthems laden with guitar harmonies, and the unmistakable sound of vocal harmonies as only the Eagles can do, has propelled the band for the past 40-plus years, positioning them as one of the most successful and popular bands in music history. Eaglemania performs all of the hits of the Eagles, as well as Don Henley,<br/>
Glen Frey, and Joe Walsh’s solo albums. Their attention to detail and their ability to reproduce the Eagles exactly leaves their fans with an experience that they do not soon forget. People often remark that if they closed their eyes they would think they were listening to the actual Eagles live in concert. The band consists of an ensemble of veteran musicians whose goal is to faithfully reproduce the Eagle’s repertoire, music they love to sing and play, always committed to giving their audience a perfect show every time they take the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Journeyman:</strong><br/>
The ONLY nationally touring tribute to ERIC CLAPTON!<br/>
Fronted by Shaun Hague (Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Amos Lee, John Waite), JOURNEYMAN has become the #1 tribute to Clapton in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>The band has been selling hundreds of tickets per night in the Midwest, New England and West Coast. With over 50 years of music to chose from, JOURNEYMAN covers it all – “Layla”, “Badge”, “The Core”, “White Room”, “Lay Down Sally”, “Tulsa Time”, “Cocaine” and many more.</p>
<p>“This show would bring Clapton to his knees”- Grace Blake / Talent Buyer @ The Iridium, NY, NY</p>
<p>“This gifted group of musicians channel the spirit, passion and musicianship of Clapton himself. The guitar playing is spot on recreating the Clapton catalog in all its splendid glory”- Patrick Norton / Talent Buyer @ Narrows Center for the Arts – Fall River, MA</p>
<p>“The best Eric Clapton tribute that we have ever worked with.”- Adam Spriggs / Talent Buyer @ Saint Rocke – Hermosa Beach, CA</p>
<p><strong>Pettybreakers:</strong><br/>
Pettybreakers – Nation’s premier Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers Tribute<br/>
The PettyBreakers is the nation’s premier “Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers” tribute act. Based out of Southern California, this band is comprised of veteran musicians with decades of experience performing in tribute acts, and recording and performing with international bands like THE REMBRANDTS and THE GIN BLOSSOMS. The PettyBreakers puts on a show that recreates the sights, sounds and live experience of a Tom Petty concert.</p>
